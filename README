GOSSIP
------
Old project I'm putting up which might be of use to someone. 

See http://www.slideshare.net/marcusf/gossip-project-presentation-presentation for introduction. 
Note that the presentation was given in the context of a school demonstration with specific agenda,
mostly to highlight how we used our framework, what libraries were employed and how we worked
with AJAX. It feels a bit dated today, especially the AJAX part. What ya gonna do.

Developed in the spring of 2008, without really using SCM, so no revision log.
